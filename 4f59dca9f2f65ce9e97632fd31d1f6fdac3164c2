- brought back to life for shitty project, that don't want to port their big software to new autoconf (like mozilla, php)
- adapted to new times
- descriptions from HEAD autoconf.spec
- brought from an unlucky autoconf-2_13-13 tag
- I'll burn in hell for bringing back kloczeks work out of oblivion!
