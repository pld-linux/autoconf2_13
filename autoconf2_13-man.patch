+.SH NAME
+autoconf - creates scripts to configure source code packages using templates
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B autoconf
+[
+.B --help
+|
+.B -h
+] [
+.B --localdir=dir
+|
+.B -l dir

+.B --macrodir=dir

+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.PP
+To create 
+.B configure
+from 
+.BR configure.in , run the 
+.B autoconf
+program with no arguments.  
+.B autoconf
+processes 
+.B configure.in
+with
+the 
+.B m4
+macro processor, using the Autoconf macros.  If you give
+.B autoconf
+an argument, it reads that file instead of 
+.B configure.in
+and writes the configuration script to the standard output instead of
+to 
+.B configure
+.  If you give 
+.B autoconf
+the argument 
+.BR - ,
+it reads the
+standard input instead of 
+.B configure.in
+and writes the configuration
+script on the standard output.
+.PP
+The Autoconf macros are defined in several files.  Some of the files
+are distributed with Autoconf; 
+.B autoconf
+reads them first.  Then it
+looks for the optional file 
+.B acsite.m4
+in the directory that contains
+the distributed Autoconf macro files, and for the optional file
+.B aclocal.m4
+in the current directory.  Those files can contain your
+site's or the package's own Autoconf macro definitions.  If a macro is
+defined in more than one of the files that 
+.B autoconf
+reads, the last
+definition it reads overrides the earlier ones.
+.PP
+
+.B autoconf
+accepts the following options:
+.TP
+.BI --help
+.TP
+.BI -h
+Print a summary of the command line options and exit.
+.TP
+.BI --localdir=DIR
+.TP
+.BI -l\ DIR
+Look for the package file 
+.B aclocal.m4
+in directory DIR instead of
+in the current directory.
+.TP
+.BI --macrodir=DIR
+.TP
+.BI -m\ DIR
+Look for the installed macro files in directory DIR.  You can also
+set the 
+.B AC_MACRODIR
+environment variable to a directory; this
+option overrides the environment variable.
+.TP
+.BI --version
+Print the version number of Autoconf and exit.

+.TH AUTOHEADER 1 "Autoconf"
+.SH NAME
+autoheader - creates a template file of C #define's for use by
+configure.
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B autoheader
+[
+.B --help
+|
+.B -h
+] [
+.B --localdir=dir
+|
+.B -l dir
+] [
+.B --macrodir=dir
+|
+.B -m dir
+] [
+.B --version
+]
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.PP
+The 
+.B autoheader
+program can create a template file of C 
+.B #define
+statements for 
+.B configure
+to use.  If 
+.B configure.in
+invokes
+.BR AC_CONFIG_HEADER(FILE) , 
+.B autoheader
+creates 
+.BR FILE.in ; 
+if multiple
+file arguments are given, the first one is used.  Otherwise,
+.B autoheader
+creates 
+.BR config.h.in .
+.PP
+If you give 
+.B autoheader
+an argument, it uses that file instead of
+.B configure.in
+and writes the header file to the standard output
+instead of to 
+.B config.h.in
+.  If you give 
+.B autoheader
+an argument of
+.BR - , 
+it reads the standard input instead of 
+.B configure.in
+and writes
+the header file to the standard output.
+.PP
+.B autoheader
+scans 
+.B configure.in
+and figures out which C
+preprocessor symbols it might define.  It copies comments and 
+.B #define
+and 
+.B #undef
+statements from a file called 
+.BR acconfig.h , 
+which comes
+with and is installed with Autoconf.  It also uses a file called
+.B acconfig.h
+in the current directory, if present.  If you 
+.B AC_DEFINE
+any additional symbols, you must create that file with entries for
+them.  For symbols defined by 
+.BR AC_CHECK_HEADERS , 
+.BR AC_CHECK_FUNCS ,
+.BR AC_CHECK_SIZEOF , 
+or 
+.BR AC_CHECK_LIB , 
+.B autoheader
+generates comments
+and 
+.B #undef
+statements itself rather than copying them from a file,
+since the possible symbols are effectively limitless.
+.PP
+The file that 
+.B autoheader
+creates contains mainly 
+.B #define
+and
+.B #undef
+statements and their accompanying comments.  If 
+.B ./acconfig.h
+contains the string 
+.BR @TOP@ , 
+.B autoheader
+copies the lines before the
+line containing 
+.B @TOP@
+into the top of the file that it generates.
+Similarly, if 
+.B ./acconfig.h
+contains the string 
+.BR @BOTTOM@ ,
+.B autoheader
+copies the lines after that line to the end of the file it
+generates.  Either or both of those strings may be omitted.
+.PP
+An alternate way to produce the same effect is to create the files
+.B FILE.top
+(typically 
+.BR config.h.top ) 
+and/or 
+.B FILE.bot
+in the current
+directory.  If they exist, 
+.B autoheader
+copies them to the beginning
+and end, respectively, of its output.  Their use is discouraged because
+they have file names that contain two periods, and so can not be stored
+on MS-DOS; also, they are two more files to clutter up the directory.
+But if you use the 
+.B --localdir=DIR
+option to use an 
+.B acconfig.h
+in
+another directory, they give you a way to put custom boilerplate in each
+individual 
+.BR config.h.in .
+.PP
+.B autoheader
+accepts the following options:
+.TP
+.BI --help
+.TP
+.BI -h
+Print a summary of the command line options and exit.
+.TP
+.BI --localdir=DIR
+.TP
+.BI -l\ DIR
+Look for the package files 
+.B aclocal.m4
+and 
+.B acconfig.h
+(but not
+.B FILE.top
+and 
+.BR FILE.bot ) 
+in directory DIR instead of in the current
+directory.
+.TP
+.BI --macrodir=DIR
+.TP
+.BI -m\ DIR
+Look for the installed macro files and 
+.B acconfig.h
+in directory DIR.
+You can also set the 
+.B AC_MACRODIR
+environment variable to a
+directory; this option overrides the environment variable.
+.TP
+.BI --version
+Print the version number of Autoconf and exit.

+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.PP
+If you have a lot of Autoconf-generated 
+.B configure
+scripts, the
+.B autoreconf
+program can save you some work.  It runs 
+.B autoconf
+(and
+.BR autoheader , 
+where appropriate) repeatedly to remake the Autoconf
+.B configure
+scripts and configuration header templates in the directory
+tree rooted at the current directory.  By default, it only remakes
+those files that are older than their 
+.B configure.in
+or (if present)
+.BR aclocal.m4 .  
+Since 
+.B autoheader
+does not change the timestamp of its
+output file if the file wouldn't be changing, this is not necessarily
+the minimum amount of work.  If you install a new version of Autoconf,
+you can make 
+.B autoreconf
+remake

+of the files by giving it the
+.B --force
+option.
+.PP
+If you give

+the 
+.B --macrodir=DIR

+options, it passes them down to 
+.B autoconf
+and

+(with
+relative paths adjusted properly).
+.PP
+.B autoreconf
+does not support having, in the same directory tree,
+both directories that are parts of a larger package (sharing
+.B aclocal.m4
+and 
+.BR acconfig.h ), 
+and directories that are independent
+packages (each with their own 
+.B aclocal.m4
+and 
+.BR acconfig.h ).  
+It
+assumes that they are all part of the same package, if you use
+.BR --localdir , 
+or that each directory is a separate package, if you
+don't use it.  This restriction may be removed in the future.

+Print a summary of the command line options and exit.

+.TP

+] [

+]
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+The 
+.B autoscan
+program can help you create a 
+.B configure.in
+file for a
+software package.  
+.B autoscan
+examines source files in the directory
+tree rooted at a directory given as a command line argument, or the
+current directory if none is given.  It searches the source files for
+common portability problems and creates a file 
+.B configure.scan
+which
+is a preliminary 
+.B configure.in
+for that package.
+.PP
+You should manually examine 
+.B configure.scan
+before renaming it to
+.BR configure.in ; 
+it will probably need some adjustments.  Occasionally
+.B autoscan
+outputs a macro in the wrong order relative to another
+macro, so that 
+.B autoconf
+produces a warning; you need to move such
+macros manually.  Also, if you want the package to use a configuration
+header file, you must add a call to 
+.BR AC_CONFIG_HEADER .  
+You might
+also have to change or add some 
+.B #if
+directives to your program in
+order to make it work with Autoconf (see 
+.BR ifnames (1)), 
+for information about a program that can help with that job).
+.PP
+.B autoscan
+uses several data files, which are installed along with the
+distributed Autoconf macro files, to determine which macros to output
+when it finds particular symbols in a package's source files.  These
+files all have the same format.  Each line consists of a symbol,
+whitespace, and the Autoconf macro to output if that symbol is
+encountered.  Lines starting with 
+.B #
+are comments.
+.PP
+
+.B autoscan
+requires that a Perl interpreter is installed.
+.PP
+

+The

+program updates a
